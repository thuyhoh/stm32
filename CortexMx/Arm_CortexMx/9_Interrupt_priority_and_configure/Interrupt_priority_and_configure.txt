Relation between priority value and priority
the lesser A priority value is, the more urgent a interrupt is. 	 
if both interrupts hit the NVIC at the same time, NVIC allows the interrupt which have the highest priority
if 2 interrupts have same the priority value, NVIC will allows the interrupt having numbers of interrupts.

Priority values are also called as priority levels

in STM32F4x MCU has 16 different priority levels
