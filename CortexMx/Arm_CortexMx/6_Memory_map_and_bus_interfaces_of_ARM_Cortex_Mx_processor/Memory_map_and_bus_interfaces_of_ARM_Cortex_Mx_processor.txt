Memory Map of the processor
- Memory map explains mapping of different peripheral registers and memories in the processor addressable memory location range
- The processor, addressable memory location range, depends upon the size of the address bus.
- The mapping of different regions in the addressable memory location range is called 'memory map'
- imagines: <memory_map>
* code region:  
	- This is the region where the MCU vendors should connect CODE memory
	- Different type of Code memory are: Embedded flash, Rom, OTP, EEPROM, etc
	- Processor by default fetches vector right after reset
*SRAM region:
	- The SRAM(Static-RAM) region is in the next 512MB of memory space after the CODE 	 region
	- it is primarily for connecting SRAM, mostly on-chip SRAM.
	- The first 1 MB of SRAM 
*Peripherals Region
	- The peripheral memory region also has the size of 512MB
	- Used mostly for on-chip peripherals
	- Like the SRAM region, the first 1MB of the peripheral region is bit addressable. 
	 If the optional bit-band feature is included
	- This is an eXecute Never (XN) region
	- Trying to execute code from this region will trigger fault exception
*External RAM Region
	- This region is intended for either on-chip or off-chip memory
	- You can execute code in this region
	- Connecting external SDRAM
*External Device Region
	- This region is intended for external devices and/or share memory
	- This is a eXecute Never (XN) region
*Private Peripheral Bus Region
	- This region includes the NVIC, system timer, and system control block
	- This is a eXecute Never (XN) region

Bus Protocols and Bus interfaces
- In Cortex MX processors the bus interfaces are based on advanced microcontroller bus architecture(AMBA) specification
- AMBA is a specification designed by ARM which governs standard for on-chip communication inside the system on chip
- AMBA specification supports several bus protocols
	+ AHB Lite (AMBA High-performance Bus)
	+ APB (AMBA Peripheral Bus)
* AHB and APB
	- AHB lite bus is mainly used for the main bus interface
	- APB bus is used for PPB access and some on-chip peripheral access using an 
	 AHB-APB bridge
	- APB bus in used for low-speed communication compared to AHB. Most of the 	 	 peripherals which don't require high operation speed are connected to this bus

Bit Band and Bit Band alias addresses
- It's the capability to address a single bit of a memory address.
- this feature is optional. i.e., MCU manufacturer supports it or many not support this feature. Refer to reference manual 
- Bit-banding is available for Sram and Peripheral region
- Bit-banding provides atomic operations to bit data.
Calculation of bit band alias address
- Calculate the bit band alias address for given bit band memory address and bit position
- General formula:
	Alias_addr = alias_base + (32*(bit_band_memory_addr - bit_band_base))+ bit*4
