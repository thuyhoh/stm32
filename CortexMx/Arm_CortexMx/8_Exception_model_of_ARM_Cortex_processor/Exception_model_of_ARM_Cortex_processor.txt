Cortex M processor Exception model

1; what is exception ?
Anything which disturbs the normal operation of the program by changing the operational mode of the processor
 
There are 2 type of exceptions
- System exceptions: are generated by the processor itself internally 
- Interrupt: come from the external world to the processor

whenever the processor core meets with an 
exception it changes the operational mode to "Handler mode"

There are total 15 system exceptions and 240 interrupts supported by the cortex M processor.

ARM Cortex Mx : Different System Exceptions
1; There is room for 15 system exceptions 
2; the number 1 exception is called Reset Exception(or system exception)
3; only 9 implemented system exceptions. 6 are reserved for future implementations.
4; Exception number 16 is Interrupt 1 (IQR 1)

NVIC(Nested Vector interrupt Control)
1; NVIC is one of the peripherals of the Cortex M processor core
2; it is used to configure the 240 interrupts
3; using NVIC register you can Enable/Disable/Pend various interrupts and read the status of the active and pending interrupts
4; you can configure the priority and priority grouping of various interrupt
5 it is called as "Nested" because, it supports pre-empting a lower priority interrupt handler when higher priority interrupt arrives
